#### Questions and queries

1. Null or empty values are usually a problem. Think about why those null values can appear and think of ways of dealing with them.

*I think NULL values are rather than a probles, just a slight inconvenience. 
It is true that when carrzing out EDA, it is better and in most cases necesarz to have a clean dataset 
free of nulls. 

We have plent of tools to deal with null values. Whether thez should be erradicated 
entirelz from the dataset should be treated in a case bz case bases, depending on the tzpe of
analiszs we are trzing to make.

From the perspective of database normalization, nulls are frowned upon. The rationale being that 
if a value can be nothing, then you should split it out into another sparse table so that you don't
have to hold rows for items with no worth. 
 
It's an effort to ensure that all information is valid and meaningful. 
Having a null field in some circumstances may be advantageous, especially when seeking to minimize the number of joins (
although this shouldn't be an issue unless the database engine is configured correctly).
 
Answer: Null values appear for three reasons: data was not recorded, an unknown value (such as a parameter to a function), and the result of divide by zero.

Nulls are one of the most difficult things in SQL because SQL doesn't have a "none" symbol
to represent these values. Because nulls are often used when there is no more information 
or on input parameters, where the user has left some amount of information blank, it becomes 
very hard to represent "nothing".

When dealing with null values in SQL there are three possible approaches that can be taken: 
Ignore them, if you do not need any semantics associated with their existence; replace them, 
by assigning a default value such as NULL in place of the missing column in your queries; and 
having them evaluate methods to differentiate whether it evaluates true or false i.e. ISNULL().*



2. Check for _transactions_ with null or empty values for the column `amount`.

```sql
SELECT amount
FROM trans
WHERE amount IS NULL;

SELECT count(amount)
FROM trans
WHERE amount = '';

SELECT count(amount)
FROM trans
WHERE amount IS NULL
  OR amount = '';
```




3. Count how many _transactions_ have empty and non-empty `k_symbol` (in one query).

*To check my solution, I count the total number of records I have on the column k_symbol*

```sql
SELECT sum(k_symbol = '') AS empty_rows,
       sum(k_symbol != '') AS not_empty_rows
FROM trans
WHERE k_symbol IS NOT NULL;
```
*The total of empty_rows is 415.123 and
the total of not_empty_rows is 452.896

which makes a total of 868.019 rows and
meaning that we have no null values.*
