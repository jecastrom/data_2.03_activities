Keep working on the `bank` database. (_In case you need to load data again, refer to the previous lab and `files_for_lab` folder to get the database._)

#### Queries

1. Get `card_id` and `year_issued` for all gold cards.

```sql
SELECT card_id,
       LEFT(issued, 2) AS year_issued
FROM card
WHERE TYPE = 'gold';
```

<br></br>



2. When was the first gold card **issued**? (Year)

```sql
SELECT
  type,
  MIN(issued) AS first_gold_card_issued 
FROM
  card 
WHERE
  type = 'gold';
  ```

<br></br>


3. Get issue date as:

   - `date_issued`: 'November 7th, 1993'
   - `fecha_emision`: '07 of November of 1993'

Answer:

*Note: Changing data type of the column "issued" in the "card" table
which stores dates with 2-digit years. 
Date values with 2-digit years are ambiguous because the century is unknown.*
<br></br>
*Prepended the characters "19" at the bigining 
of the year to make it a 4 digit year format.*

```sql

UPDATE card
SET    issued = Concat('19', issued); 
```

<br></br>

*Uptating the records of the column "issued" to a DATETIME format
that MySQL can understand as YYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss*

```sql

UPDATE card
SET issued = date_format(str_to_date(issued, '%Y%m%d %H:%i:%s'), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s');
```

<br></br>

*Altereing the data type of the column to datetime*

```sql

ALTER TABLE card MODIFY issued datetime;
```

<br></br> 

*date_issued: 'November 7th, 1993'*

```sql
SELECT date_format(issued, '%M %D, %Y ') AS date_issued
FROM card;
```

<br></br>

*fecha_emision: '07 of November of 1993'*

```sql

SELECT date_format(issued, '%d of %M of %Y') AS fecha_emision
FROM card;
```
